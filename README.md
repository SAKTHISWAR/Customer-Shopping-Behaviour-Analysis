# 📊 Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis
A complete data analytics project to analyze customer shopping patterns, behaviors, and trends from transaction data. This project uses Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract insights that help guide business decisions such as customer segmentation, revenue drivers, discount effectiveness, and product performance.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Understanding customer behaviour is key to improving marketing strategies, enhancing customer experience, and increasing revenue. This project transforms raw retail transaction data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL business queries, and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🎯 Objectives

Explore customer purchasing patterns across demographics and product categories.

Measure the impact of discounts, promo codes, and subscription status on buyer behaviour.

Identify top-performing products and customer segments.

Visualize key metrics in a Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

The project integrates multiple technologies to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow:

-Python & Data Analysis

-Pandas – Data handling and cleaning

-NumPy – Numerical operations

-Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment

## 🗃️ SQL & Database Analytics

SQL – Business intelligence queries for aggregated insights (PostgreSQL)

Example queries include revenue by segment, discount usage rates, shipping preferences, etc.

## 📊 Power BI Visualization

Power BI Desktop – Interactive dashboard creation.

Insights dashboard with filters for age groups, genders, product categories and revenue metrics.

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Insights

Customer Segmentation: Grouped users by age, gender, purchase frequency, and subscription status

Revenue Patterns: Identified high-value customer groups and seasonality in purchases

Discount & Promo Impact: Calculated discount usage rates and their influence on spending

Product Trends: Ranked top products by revenue, frequency, and average ratings

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### Data Loading & Cleaning

Load the raw dataset with Pandas

Handle missing values and inconsistent data types

### Feature Engineering

Create derived features such as age_group using quantile segmentation

Standardize column names for analytics

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis across age, gender, items, and categories

Visualization of purchase frequency and revenue trends

### SQL Business Queries

Load cleaned data into a SQL database

Run queries to answer business questions (e.g., top 5 products, average spend by shipping type)

### Power BI Dashboard

Connect database to Power BI

Build interactive visuals, slicers and KPI cards
